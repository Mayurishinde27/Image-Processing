## Why convert to grayscale?

- When loaded into memory, a grayscale image occupies a third of the space required for an RGB image.
- Because a grayscale image has a third of the data, it requires less computational power to process and can reduce computation time.
- A grayscale image is conceptually simpler than an RGB image, so developing an image processing algorithm can be more straightforward when working with grayscale.
